The Open-Source Smart-Metering community would like to get some realworld data 
from all those SML Smart Meters out there, so please submit some data from 
your SML capable device.


This is very valuable information to test SML parsers, to know about the 
capabilities of different Smart Meters and to get an impresseion on how good 
Smart Meters behave according to the specs.

Create dumps in binary and hex format from your smartmeter and submit those as 
follows:

1. Do proper initialization of the serial interface via stty, vzlogger, i
   <your_favourite_metering_tool> (serial interface should remain initialized 
   after terminating vzlogger etc)

2. Dump binary data to a file like this:  
   dd if=/dev/ttyUSB0 of=yoursmldump.bin bs=1 count=4096 iflag=fullblock

3. Convert your .bin file into .hex like this: 
   cat yoursmldump.bin |hexdump -ve '1/1 "%.2X"' >yoursmldump.hex

4. Name your files like this: <VENDOR>_<MODEL>-<MODELNR>.bin|hex, e.g. 
   EMH_eHZ-HW8E2AWL0EK2P.bin and EMH_eHZ-HW8E2AWL0EK2P.hex

5. If you like, add some owner/contact information, so others may contact you 
   about your smart meter and ask questions

6. As we have no better method for now, Zip your files and submit them via mail 
   to devzero AT web.de . 

7. Discuss about with others about SML on volkszaehler-dev@lists.volkszaehler.org.
